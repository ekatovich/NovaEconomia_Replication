# NovaEconomia_Replication
Replication file for data cleaning and analyses undertaken in Katovich, Erik S. and Alexandre Gori Maia, 
The Relation Between Labor Productivity and Wages in Brazil: A Sectoral Analysis. Nova Economia, 
Vol. 28, No. 1, pg. 7-38 (2018).

This Stata do-file reproduces all data cleaning and analysis steps for the paper. These steps include
1) importing and cleaning annual PNAD datasets (in raw .txt format) from 1996-2014, 2) categorizing workers into sectors 
and computing their labor productivity (wages divided by hours worked), 3) appending annual cross-sections
into pooled dataset, and running regression analyses. 

To run this file, it is necessary to compile the raw PNAD microdata files for 1996 to 2014, which may be accessed at:

Data on state-sector level value added are drawn from the Brazilian National Accounts, which may be accessed at:
